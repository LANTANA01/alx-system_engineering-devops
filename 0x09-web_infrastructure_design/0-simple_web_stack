1. **What is a Server?**
   - A server is a computer or software system that provides services, resources, or functionality to other computers or clients over a network.
   - Servers can handle various tasks, such as hosting websites, managing databases, serving files, handling email, and more.
   - In the context of web hosting, a server typically refers to a physical machine or a virtual instance that stores and delivers web content to users.

2. **Role of the Domain Name**:
   - A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify resources on the internet (e.g., websites, email servers).
   - It provides a way for users to access websites without needing to remember numeric IP addresses.
   - For example, `www.foobar.com` is a domain name.

3. **Type of DNS Record for www in www.foobar.com**:
   - The DNS record for `www.foobar.com` is typically a **CNAME (Canonical Name)** record.
   - It points the `www` subdomain to the same IP address as the root domain (`foobar.com`).

4. **Role of the Web Server**:
   - The web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) handles incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers.
   - It serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
   - The web server ensures that the correct content is delivered to users based on their requests.

5. **Role of the Application Server**:
   - The application server executes dynamic code (e.g., Python, Node.js) that generates content on the fly.
   - It processes user requests, interacts with databases, and performs business logic.
   - For example, it handles user authentication, retrieves personalized data, and constructs dynamic web pages.

6. **Role of the Database**:
   - The database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) stores structured data.
   - It holds information such as user profiles, product details, blog posts, etc.
   - The application server communicates with the database to read or write data.

7. **Server Communication with User's Computer**:
   - When a user requests a website, their computer sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address.
   - The server processes the request, constructs an HTTP response, and sends it back to the user.
   - The user's browser renders the website based on the received response.

8. **Issues with this Infrastructure**:
   - **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**:
     - Having only one server means any failure (hardware, software, or network) affects the entire system.
     - Solutions include redundancy (multiple servers) or failover mechanisms.
   - **Downtime during Maintenance**:
     - When deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, causing temporary unavailability.
     - Load balancers and rolling updates can minimize downtime.
   - **Scalability Limitations**:
     - With only one server, handling high traffic becomes challenging.
     - Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) is essential for handling increased load.
