1. **Two Additional Servers**:
   - We add two more servers to distribute the workload and improve redundancy.
   - Having multiple servers ensures better availability and fault tolerance.

2. **Web Server (Nginx)**:
   - The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests.
   - It serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
   - Nginx improves performance and load balancing.

3. **Application Server**:
   - The application server executes dynamic code (e.g., Python, Node.js).
   - It processes user requests, performs business logic, and communicates with the database.
   - Separating application logic from the web server enhances scalability.

4. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**:
   - The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers.
   - It uses a distribution algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections) to balance the load.
   - HAproxy ensures high availability and prevents overload on any single server.

5. **Database (MySQL)**:
   - The database stores structured data (e.g., user profiles, product information).
   - MySQL provides data persistence and retrieval.
   - We set up a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster for redundancy.

6. **Primary-Replica Database Cluster**:
   - The Primary (Master) node handles write operations (inserts, updates).
   - The Replica (Slave) nodes replicate data from the Primary and handle read operations.
   - This setup improves performance and provides failover capability.

7. **Issues with this Infrastructure**:
   - **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**:
     - The load balancer can become a SPOF if it fails.
     - Consider adding a redundant load balancer.
   - **Security Issues**:
     - No firewall mentioned; we need proper network security rules.
     - No HTTPS (SSL/TLS); secure communication is essential.
   - **No Monitoring**:
     - Lack of monitoring tools means we can't detect issues promptly.
     - Implement monitoring for performance, availability, and security.
