1. **Server**:
   - We add a new server to improve redundancy and distribute the workload.
   - Having multiple servers ensures better availability and fault tolerance.

2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**:
   - The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers.
   - It ensures even traffic distribution, prevents overload, and enhances performance.
   - Configuring it as a cluster with another load balancer provides failover capability.

3. **Split Components**:
   - We separate components onto different servers for several reasons:
     - **Web Server**: Handles HTTP requests, serves static files (e.g., HTML, CSS).
     - **Application Server**: Executes dynamic code (e.g., Python, Node.js), processes requests.
     - **Database Server**: Stores structured data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
     - Isolating components improves scalability, security, and maintenance.
